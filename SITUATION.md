üîç Complete Situation Summary

  ‚úÖ What We Know For Certain

  Database Reality Check:
  - Tables Exist: Direct PostgreSQL queries confirm Supabase database contains:
    - 9 documents ingested
    - 136 chunks created
    - 4-5 sessions (including successful ones from /chat endpoint)
    - 4+ messages stored
  - Schema Structure: Tables are in public schema, but there's also an auth.sessions table (Supabase built-in)

  Endpoint Behavior:
  - Regular /chat Works Perfectly: Creates valid sessions, saves to database, executes agent, returns responses
  - OpenAI /v1/chat/completions Fails Consistently:
    - Generates new UUIDs each time: d2647dd2-8552-5767-dd3a-d5765b689082, e0642b3c-d6d6-1919-6200-89c68082462a,
  4fcd70d6-f006-64a6-5ca0-c2322a514c7e
    - Foreign key constraint violations: sessions don't exist when trying to save messages
    - HTTP 500 errors every time

  üö® Critical Red Flags

  Container Development Issues:
  - Code Changes Not Reflected: Despite rebuilding containers, our debug print statements and logging never appear
  - Suggests: Either container isn't using our updated code, or there's a different code path being executed

  Database Visibility Confusion:
  - Supabase Studio Empty: Web interface at localhost:8005 shows no tables despite data existing
  - Suggests: Studio pointing to different schema/database, or permissions issue

  Session Creation Mystery:
  - UUIDs Generated But Not Found: OpenAI endpoint creates valid UUIDs but they're never in the database
  - Suggests: Different database connection, transaction rollback, or different session creation logic

  ü§î Working Hypotheses

  1. Multiple Database Instances: The agent might be connecting to a different database than what we're querying directly
  2. Container Mount Issues: Code changes aren't being picked up due to volume mounting or build context problems
  3. Schema/Connection Mismatch: OpenAI endpoint uses different database connection logic than regular endpoint
  4. Transaction Issues: Sessions created but not committed in OpenAI endpoint flow
  5. OpenWebUI Integration Gap: We don't understand how OpenWebUI expects the endpoint to behave

  üìã Everything We've Tried

  Code Analysis & Debugging:
  - ‚úÖ Compared session creation logic between endpoints (appeared identical)
  - ‚úÖ Added extensive debug logging at INFO level (never appeared)
  - ‚úÖ Added print statements (never appeared)
  - ‚úÖ Verified regular endpoint creates sessions successfully

  Database Investigation:
  - ‚úÖ Direct PostgreSQL queries to verify data existence
  - ‚úÖ Checked for schema conflicts (public.sessions vs auth.sessions)
  - ‚úÖ Verified foreign key constraints and table structure

  Container Management:
  - ‚úÖ Rebuilt agent container with docker-compose build agent
  - ‚úÖ Restarted containers multiple times
  - ‚úÖ Checked container file system for code updates

  üî¨ Research Plan for Resolution

  4. Session Management Best Practices Research

  Goal: Implement correct session handling for OpenAI endpoints

  Research Areas:
  - OpenAI API Standards:
    - Official session management (if any)
    - Conversation ID handling
    - State persistence patterns
  - Database Transaction Patterns:
    - Session creation with immediate verification
    - Transaction isolation levels
    - Rollback scenarios and prevention
  - API Gateway Patterns:
    - How to bridge between different session models
    - Request/response transformation
    - State synchronization

  üìä Specific Research Questions to Answer

  OpenWebUI Integration:
  1. Does OpenWebUI send any special headers or session identifiers?
  2. How does OpenWebUI handle conversation persistence across page refreshes?
  3. What authentication does OpenWebUI expect from /v1/chat/completions?
  4. Does OpenWebUI require specific response formats or status codes?

  Database Architecture:
  1. Are there multiple PostgreSQL instances running in the Docker setup?
  2. How should Supabase Studio be configured to see custom schemas?
  3. What's the correct DATABASE_URL pattern for container networking?
  4. Why might sessions be created but not visible in queries?

  Container Development:
  1. What's the correct way to develop with Docker Compose for live code updates?
  2. How can we verify that code changes are actually in the running container?
  3. Are there volume mounts missing for development workflow?
  4. How should logging be configured to ensure visibility?

  üéØ Success Criteria for Research

  After research, we should have:
  1. Clear OpenWebUI integration pattern with working examples
  2. Database connection verification method to ensure we're hitting the right instance
  3. Container development workflow that reflects code changes immediately
  4. Session management implementation that works with both endpoints
  5. Root cause identification for why our debugging attempts failed

  This research will help us move from "trial and error debugging" to "informed architectural fixes" based on how these systems are actually
  supposed to work together.
