ðŸš§ To Do

- T1 Create Dockerfile for agentic-rag-knowledge-graph  
- T2 Add agent service to existing docker-compose.yml  
- T3 Configure container networking (agent â†” supabase â†” neo4j)  
- T4 Set up proper environment variable passing to agent container  
- T5 Add basic health check endpoint to FastAPI (/health)  
- T6 Test full containerized stack: docker-compose up -d  
- T7 Verify agent can connect to databases from inside container  
- T8 Test ingestion pipeline from containerized agent  
- T9 Test CLI/API access to containerized agent  
- T10 Create simple make up target for easy startup

âœ… Done

- Local Python application working  
- Docker infrastructure (Supabase, Neo4j) working  
- Vector + Knowledge graph functionality working

No Repository Restructuring

- Keep everything where it is
- Just add Dockerfile and update docker-compose.yml  
- Focus on getting containers talking to each other
- Save CI/CD and complex restructuring for later phases

Success Metric

docker-compose up -d starts everything and the agent can answer: "What are Google's AI 
initiatives?" using both vector search and knowledge graph data.
